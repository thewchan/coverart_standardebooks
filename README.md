# coverart_standardebooks

Cover art repository for ebooks produced by [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/)

## Project requirements

### Purpose

The repository page will provide a place for Standard Ebooks producer to effectively
 peruse artwork used for past ebook productions, as well as approved artwork
 available for used for future ebook cover art.

### Motivation

The general consensus from Standard Ebooks producers and staff is that finding
 stylistic appropriate yet thematically suitable artworks that is provably
 released to the public domain (or CC0 licensed) for the cover art of an
 ebook production is by far the most arduous step in the entire process. This
 repository page will aim to reduce that friction by providing a record of
 approved artwork used in the past, as well as a clearing house for submitting
 artwork as candidates for future use.

### Desired features

The Standard Ebooks cover art repository should:

- Be searchable.
  - By name.
  - By author.
  - By completion year.
  - By Standard Ebooks production title (for past cover art)
  - Fuzzy search is necessary due to potential conflicting spellings (e.g. author names.)
  - Descriptive tags or labels.
- Store data on a robust database.
- Accept artwork submission from Standard Ebooks contributors.
  - Clear submission requirements (art style, public domain requirements, etc.)
  - Store submission data and file(s) for staff approval.
  - Record submitter and approver of the file(s), and other relevant information (e.g. date and time).
- Update database as needed.
  - After each new ebook release.
  - After submission is approved.
  - Correctly classify artwork in repository as used in past ebooks or unused.
  - In rare occasion if a past ebook cover art is modified, made the necessary
   modification in the database.
- Contains a gallery page.
  - Gallery should contain thumbnail images for all artworks.
  - A reasonably high resolution image of the artwork is viewable if desired.
- Perform user authentication.
  - Artwork submitters are able to make an account with password authentication.
  - Selected users are given artwork approval permissions.
  - Selected users are given elevated administrative permissions.
